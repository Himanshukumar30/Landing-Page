I developed this project as part of Udacity nano-degree program.

**Description**

- This project is a multi section landing page, which dynamically modifies the DOM with the help of Javascript. The navigation menu is build using event listeners when the page is loaded.
- Each navigation element is attached to its section using id.
- Once the page loads up, User sees the active state of the page with highlight on the current section on the viewport being viewed. Here, I have differentiated with the different color being highlighted.
- Another functionality in the project involves the scroll to section on click. Clicking an item in the navbar will scroll you to the section being clicked and the navbar item will also be highlighted with red color on the section you are currently on.
- Once you scroll down the page, you do have the button to scroll back to top instantly.
